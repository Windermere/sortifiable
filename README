== Sortifiable

This gem provides an acts_as_list compatible capability for sorting
and reordering a number of objects in a list. The class that has this
specified needs to have a +position+ column defined as an integer on
the mapped database table.

This gem requires ActiveRecord 3.0 as it has been refactored to use
the scope methods and query interface introduced with Ruby on Rails 3.0


=== Example

  class TodoList < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :todo_items, :order => "position"
  end

  class TodoItem < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :todo_list
    acts_as_list :scope => :todo_list
  end

  todo_list.first.move_to_bottom
  todo_list.last.move_higher
